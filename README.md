# rtree-3d
3D R-Tree in java.

Three dimensional R-Tree in java motivated by spatio-temporal queries. Nodes would be serialized to disk or network storage.  

Status: *pre-alpha*

Progress is being made on this project. I've copied my 2D [rtree](https://github.com/davidmoten/rtree) implementation and beefed it up for 3D. 

* expanded the R*Star
